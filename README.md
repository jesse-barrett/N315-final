## Details

This is a mock of Keurig's website. More specifically, the coffee makers product page and the shopping cart. The site is fairly accurate to the original, and is responsive with light user feedback.

Regrettably, my shopping cart has some minor functionality issues. Items can be added to the cart, but for some reason I can't get the items to actually appear on the page. I've spent hours troubleshooting the issue to no avail. My current leading theory is that my application is attempting to append the shopping cart to the screen before the page has loaded, but I've tried multiple iterations of callback functions with no success.

Additionally, Firebase compatibility is good to go, but I didn't set aside enough time for an interface while trying to work through the afforementioned shopping cart issues.
